Various utility scripts
=======================

**subst.sed** is a sed script that converts a Greek text written in the
traditional system, with all accents and breathing marks, to the recently
introduced and imposed, oversimplified, "monotonic" (more accurately monotone) system. 
The script has been tested to work with [Heilroom Project's](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/) 
sed.
