Various utility scripts
=======================

**subst.sed** is a sed script that converts a Greek text written in the
traditional (“polytonic”) system, with all accents and breathing marks, to the
recently introduced and imposed, oversimplified, “monotonic” (more accurate
would be to be called “monotone”) system.  The script has been tested to work
with [Heirloom Project's](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/) sed.  Nevertheless
it seems to work properly even when it's used with standard sed.
